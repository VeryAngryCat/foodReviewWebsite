# foodReviewWebsite

The purpose of the database system is to manage and facilitate food reviews for restaurants. Our database has five main requirements:

> User management: contains user information like login credentials.
> Administrator management: admins can control the database to some extent from a separate interface
> Restaurant and cuisine management: maintains different restaurants and details like their cuisines, and the dishes they offer. 
> Ratings and reviews: users are allowed to give rating and reviews for restaurants  
> Favourites: users can save their favourite restaurants for easy access
> Dietary Preferences: helps users filter food options based on their dietary restrictions or choices

The general system allows users to explore various restaurants, cuisines, and dishes while providing feedback through reviews and ratings.
